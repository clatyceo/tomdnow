# Why Every Developer Needs a Markdown Converter in Their Toolkit

Markdown has quietly become the lingua franca of the developer world. GitHub READMEs, Obsidian vaults, Notion pages, Jupyter notebooks, static site generators, AI prompt inputs -- they all speak Markdown. But your files don't.

Your inbox has PDFs. Your company runs on Word documents. Your clients send PowerPoint decks. Your government sends you formats you've never heard of. The gap between "where your content lives" and "where you need it" is almost always a format conversion problem.

Here's why having a reliable file-to-Markdown converter is more useful than you think, and a look at the options available.

## Markdown Is Everywhere (and Expanding)

A quick inventory of tools in a typical developer's stack that consume or produce Markdown:

- **GitHub / GitLab** -- READMEs, issues, PRs, wikis
- **Obsidian / Logseq / Foam** -- personal knowledge management
- **Notion** -- team wikis and docs (exports to Markdown)
- **Jupyter** -- notebook cells support Markdown
- **Hugo / Jekyll / Astro** -- static site content
- **ChatGPT / Claude / Gemini** -- Markdown is the preferred structured input and output format
- **Slack / Discord** -- message formatting uses Markdown subsets

Markdown isn't just a format. It's the universal interchange layer for text-based content. If you can get something into Markdown, you can get it into almost anything.

## The Conversion Problem

But most of the world's documents aren't in Markdown. They're in:

- **PDF** -- the format that everything gets exported to but nothing imports from
- **DOCX** -- the corporate default
- **XLSX** -- data trapped in spreadsheet formatting
- **PPTX** -- knowledge locked in slide decks
- **HTML** -- web content you want to save locally
- **EPUB** -- books and long-form content
- **Legacy formats** -- RTF, CSV, XML, and regional formats like HWP

Getting clean, structured Markdown out of these formats is harder than it should be. Copy-paste mangles tables. Online converters add watermarks or require accounts. CLI tools require setup and format-specific flags.

## Use Case 1: AI Workflows

This is the use case that drove me to build [tomdnow](https://tomdnow.com).

AI models like ChatGPT and Claude work best when you give them clean, structured text. Markdown is ideal -- it preserves headings, lists, tables, and emphasis without the noise of HTML or the opacity of binary formats.

The workflow:

1. Receive a 40-page PDF report
2. Convert to Markdown using tomdnow
3. Paste into Claude or ChatGPT: "Summarize the key findings" / "Extract action items" / "Translate to Korean"
4. Get structured, accurate output because the input was structured

This works dramatically better than uploading a raw PDF to most AI tools, which often struggle with complex layouts, multi-column text, and embedded tables.

## Use Case 2: Obsidian and Personal Knowledge Management

If you use Obsidian, Logseq, or any Markdown-based PKM tool, you've hit this wall: you find a great academic paper (PDF), a useful report (DOCX), or meeting notes (PPTX), and you want it in your vault. But your vault only speaks Markdown.

Convert first, then import. The result is a searchable, linkable, taggable note that lives alongside everything else in your knowledge graph. No more "I know I read this in a PDF somewhere."

This is especially powerful for researchers and students who process dozens of papers. Convert the PDF, add your annotations in Markdown, and link it to your other notes.

## Use Case 3: Documentation Migration

Teams sitting on years of legacy documentation in Word, Google Docs exports, or HTML wikis face a common challenge when moving to GitHub-based docs or a static site generator: everything needs to be Markdown.

Manual conversion of hundreds of documents is not realistic. A batch converter that handles the common formats (DOCX, HTML, PDF) and produces clean Markdown cuts that migration from weeks to hours.

For API-friendly converters, you can even script the migration:

```bash
for file in ./legacy-docs/*; do
  curl -X POST https://api.tomdnow.com/convert \
    -F "file=@$file" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY" \
    -o "./markdown-docs/$(basename $file .docx).md"
done
```

## Use Case 4: Korean Documents (HWP/HWPX)

This one is niche but real. In South Korea, the dominant document format is HWP (Hangul Word Processor). Government forms, corporate reports, legal documents, academic papers -- all HWP.

If you work with Korean organizations or clients, you've received HWP files that you literally cannot open without specialized software. Converting HWP to Markdown makes these documents accessible to the rest of the world -- readable, searchable, and compatible with every tool in your stack.

tomdnow supports both legacy HWP and the newer XML-based HWPX format. As far as I know, it's one of very few web-based tools that does this.

## Comparison: Your Options

Here's an honest look at the tools available for file-to-Markdown conversion:

| Tool | Formats | Privacy | Cost | Self-hostable | API |
|------|---------|---------|------|---------------|-----|
| **Pandoc** | Many (no HWP, no OCR) | Local (CLI) | Free | Yes (local) | No |
| **CloudConvert** | Many | Cloud (files stored) | Freemium | No | Yes (paid) |
| **Marker** | PDF only | Local | Free | Yes | No |
| **tomdnow** | 20+ (incl. HWP, OCR) | In-memory only | Free | Yes (Docker) | Yes (free tier) |

**Pandoc** is the gold standard for local conversion and supports a huge range of formats. But it requires CLI comfort, doesn't handle OCR or HWP, and there's no web UI for quick one-off conversions.

**CloudConvert** is polished and powerful but stores your files on their servers, costs money for regular use, and doesn't specifically target Markdown output quality.

**Marker** is excellent for PDF-to-Markdown specifically but doesn't cover other formats.

**tomdnow** sits in a specific niche: broad format support, web-based with zero storage, free, and open source. It's not trying to replace Pandoc for power users who live in the terminal. It's for everyone else who needs quick, private, reliable conversion from whatever format they just received.

## Try It

- **Web tool:** [tomdnow.com](https://tomdnow.com) -- drag, drop, convert, copy. No sign-up.
- **Free API (50 req/day):** [tomdnow.com/en/docs/api](https://tomdnow.com/en/docs/api)
- **Open source:** [github.com/clatyceo/tomarkdown](https://github.com/clatyceo/tomarkdown)

Markdown is the connective tissue of the modern developer toolkit. Having a reliable way to get content into Markdown -- from any format, without compromising privacy -- is one of those small tools that saves more time than you'd expect.
